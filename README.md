JavaGenerator
===============

The Haskell modules generate Java record/array type matrices (any size) and code which calculate their determinant.

The CreateFiles module produces the Java files, which are prettyprinted through the PrettyPrint modules. The output Java files are then stored in directory assignment3. 

The JUnit test file is provided to show that the determinants are correctly computed.
